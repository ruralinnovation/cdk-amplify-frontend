Amplify / React Frontend Minimal Application
============================================

## Running Code

Copy the `.env` file to a file called `.env.development.local`. Update the value for the environment variables in `.env.development.local` as needed (i.e. change `VITE_API_BACKEND=https://frontend.ruralopportunitymap.us` to `VITE_API_BACKEND=http://127.0.0.1:5174` in order for the local development frontend to connect to the local backend server).

*NOTE*: _If you plan on using `npm run build` to output a static version of the frontend to the `dist` folder, those files will also be copied over the `src/www` folder, which is where both the Shiny server and the Dockerfile source the frontend files from. So, if you have set special values in `.env.development.local` they will get copied into the static frontend build, and subsequently into the Docker build, so... beware of this._

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to run the frontend React dev server.

Run `npm run start` to call RScript and start the Plumber/Shiny server.
